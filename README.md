Readme - v.1.1 - 2024-11-10

This is the main code file for my 7D2D xml helper program.

You can check/adjust the code to optimize the setting, e.g. you think the cities are too large with my values.

Now just some general info about the program you also read at nexus, steam and 7daysmods:

The tool is no actual mod but a .exe to help you adjusting various xml files (configuration files) from 7d2d.
Download links:

Unpack the zip file and double click the XML Helper and Map Check.exe.
No installation necessary.

The first thing this programs does is to make BACKUPs of all files before any change. Just in case anything weired happens

For detail explanation about the actual settings and values please refer to the steam guide i made for this program:
